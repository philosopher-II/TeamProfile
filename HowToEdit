There are 3 pages that you need to look at, index.html, generic.html and elements.html

In index.html scroll down to below line 50 and edit the paragraph with your name to be your personal profile paragraph.

In generic.html got down to below line 45 and you will see some commented out images, uncomment them and change them to your
your results image from the first assignment (I stuck mine together in paint so it was just one). Once they are all up there
we can figure out what to write about them for the Team profile section.

In elements.html go down to about line 40 and add a sentence or two describing your ideal job, I'll do the comparison and
format it properly after you're done.
