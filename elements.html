									<h2>Daniel's Ideal Job - Video Game Designer</h2>
									<p>My ideal job is as a designer in a games studio. I like the role of designer because it allows me to very directly sculpt player experiances
										 as well as take on challenges from many different aspects of game makeing. This is because designers are expected to be able to not only code 
										 and write as might be expected, but also understand or be proficient in the other fields of game making as well.

						its a customer service technical support role which I think I'm capable of doing now but there's more experience needed for the other roles you have to do. The job requires you to have the following:<ul><li>You will need to have a degree in Information Systems and computer science or a similar degree</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Programming knowledge & experience an advantage such as VB Scripts, HTML, Javascript and SQL.</li><li>Strong communication with customers and co-workers</li><li>Ability to learn quickly on your own and under minimal supervision</li><li>Experience in conflict-resolution applied at both a customer & internal level</li></ul>
