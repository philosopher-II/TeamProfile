									<h3>Daniel's Ideal Job - Video Game Designer</h3>
									<p>My ideal job is as a designer in a games studio. I like the role of designer because it allows me to very directly sculpt player experiances
										 as well as take on challenges from many different aspects of game makeing. This is because designers are expected to be able to not only code 
										 and write as might be expected, but also understand or be proficient in the other fields of game making as well.
									</p>

									<h3>Joey's Ideal Job - AI Engineer</h3>
									<p>The job that I have selected as my ideal job is one within the field of Artificial intelligence. The idea of AI is extremely fascinating to me as the possibilities for applications are endless. 
									It seems like it is the pinnacle technology for humankind to aspire for as once it is created it will completely revolutionise society. 
									This job requires a relevant degree in the field as well as experience working with programming languages, software design, data structures and computing algorithms. 
									Furthermore, it lists ‘preferred qualifications’ such as experience with machine learning systems and knowledge of data warehousing concepts. </p>

									<p>The technical skills I currently possess are not adequate for this job as they are in the field of Client Support and Managed Operating Environment Administration. 
									The listing does, however, mention “Experience working with technical customers and senior management” as well as “Experience working across organisational boundaries”; both of which were part of my previous roles in other companies. 
										I hope to obtain the qualifications for this position through some of my studies at university as well as undertaking post-graduate positions in similar companies dealing with machine learning or deep learning algorithms where the experience will carry over. 
										I plan to slowly build my technical knowledge and industry experience until I am able to obtain my career goals.</p>

									<h3> Sunny's Ideal Job - AWS Engineer </h3>
									<p>Over recent years AWS has sparked form nothing to become the biggest Cloud provider, I
										consider this an ideal job,because i would love to learn how the world is evolving with cloud based tehcnology
										and what better company to work for than Amazon.
									<p>

									<h3> Wade's Ideal Job </h3>
									<p>An ideal Job after graduation would look like this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38578260?searchrequesttoken=005d7618-6e5b-4cc9-a4aa-721203e49cf0&type=standard"width="120"></a>Click here for the link.</a>
										This is the sort of job I think I can get into after graduating. Its a graduate developer / Technical support role in Melbourne. 
										For me, to succeed in a position like this I will need. It looks appealing to me because it's a good place to start my i.t career and further develop my skills in the industry. 
										its a customer service technical support role which I think I'm capable of doing now but there's more experience needed for the other roles you have to do. The job requires you to have the following:<ul><li>You will need to have a degree in Information Systems and computer science or a similar degree</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Programming knowledge & experience an advantage such as VB Scripts, HTML, Javascript and SQL.</li><li>Strong communication with customers and co-workers</li><li>Ability to learn quickly on your own and under minimal supervision</li><li>Experience in conflict-resolution applied at both a customer & internal level</li></ul>
									
									<h3>Comparison of Jobs</h3>
									<p>Whilst our chosen careers are in radically different IT fields, they share many similarities. They all require a strong background in teamwork, 
										both working within a single team and with other teams in the same company. They require strong communication skills, both within the immediate 
										work environment and with customers/potential customers. They also require at least a basic understanding of common programing languages.
									</p>
									<p>The key differences in our chosen careers are in the specifics of what’s required, in the case of games development and machine learning a strong 
										understanding of specific programming languages is required. An AWS Engineer needs to have a good back ground in many different operating systems 
										as well as strong understanding of web architecture. Someone in technical support will need to be able strong background in the field they are 
										supporting to deal with clients who might not have an IT background.
