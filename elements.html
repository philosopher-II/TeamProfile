								<h3> Wade's Ideal Job </h3>
									<p>An ideal Job after graduation would look like this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38578260?searchrequesttoken=005d7618-6e5b-4cc9-a4aa-721203e49cf0&type=standard"width="120"></a>Click here for the link.</a>
						This is the sort of job I think I can get into after graduating. Its a graduate developer / Technical support role in Melbourne. 
						For me, to succeed in a position like this I will need. It looks appealing to me because it's a good place to start my i.t career and further develop my skills in the industry. 
						its a customer service technical support role which I think I'm capable of doing now but there's more experience needed for the other roles you have to do. The job requires you to have the following:<ul><li>You will need to have a degree in Information Systems and computer science or a similar degree</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Programming knowledge & experience an advantage such as VB Scripts, HTML, Javascript and SQL.</li><li>Strong communication with customers and co-workers</li><li>Ability to learn quickly on your own and under minimal supervision</li><li>Experience in conflict-resolution applied at both a customer & internal level</li></ul>
