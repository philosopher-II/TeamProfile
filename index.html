									<h2><a href="#">Personal Information</a></h2>
									<h3>Daniel Ferguson, s3793771</h3>
									<p> I'm a student with a lifelong passion for IT. Although I have limited qualifications 
										(hence my decision to come to university), I hope my experience in a number of IT related fields will be useful to Team 63. 
										These fields include programming in java, lua, c# and html. Working with both Windows and many different Linux distributions 
										as well as some network administration. Some of my hobbies include, video gameing, both playing and making. Along with 
										mountain biking which I have recently gotten back into after a fairly long hiatus.

<p>### Personal Information: (not sure how to add subheaders with this HTML thingy) 								
									
- Name: Joseph Mirarchi
													
- Student No.#: s3375580								
									
- Email: S3375580@student.rmit.edu.au								
									
- Languages spoken: English, Italian, Japanese
																	

### About Me: (not sure how to add subheaders with this HTML thingy) 
									
Recently, I just finished a contract with DXC (Formerly HPE & CSC) in a senior position to pursue a relevant university qualification within the realm of IT. I have been working in the Industry since I was 15 years old, as my father used to have me come into his business to support his staff and maintain the equipment.
Currently, I have a tortoise shell kitten named Luna and a Maltese Terrier named Odie. My passions include but are not limited to; video games, movies, basketball, philosophy and eating out.  Furthermore, in 2015 I was signed to a major E-Sports organisation and played video games competitively for 2 years.
									
### Education	
									
I have attended an all-boys private school since I was 8 years old* undertaking a variety of both academic and personal challenges including the Australian Cadet Unit and even some Australian mathematical and science competitions.
Furthermore, in 2016 I completed a CompTIA A+ IT certification as a bonus from my employer at the time. 
									
## Interest in IT:								
									
I have always had an interest in computers – even from a very young age. I would assume the spark was ignited when my father bought our family’s first computer for the purposes of ‘study’ as my eldest sister had just entered into high school at the time. Obviously, study is not the only thing it was used for as I remember eagerly sitting behind my sister watching her play browser games and chat with her friends on MSN messenger. Ever since then, I have been drawn to the IT sphere whether it be in free time or in my professional career. My work experience in IT includes positions in various companies such as DXC, MyHealth Medical, Mortgage Choice and Downer**. 

### Why RMIT?
																	
I have chosen to study at RMIT University as I believe that pursuing additional tertiary qualifications will help develop myself both academically and professionally. Moreover, I have always wanted to be apart of the development of software applications. As the world moves towards a more technology assisted society, I personally believe that skills within the IT sphere will become more and more necessary. 
What do you expect to learn during your studies?
The ideal end-goal for my studies has changed quite a lot since it’s first inception quite a few months ago. I believe that as I progress through my studies it will allow me to develop a clear understanding of what the different areas of IT are and exact avenues I wish to pursue. At the current moment, I am hoping that by the end of my time here, I will be able to create/develop my own programs from scratch.

									<h3>Sunny Ng - S3681050</h3>
									<p>My name is Sunny Ng. I am a Chinese born Australian. I speak 2 languages (English and Cantonese).<br />

I enjoy watching documentaries on YouTube as it’s a great way to past the time. I.T. has always been an interest of mine, starting from the point of building my own PC, to trending on all the latest technology and gadgets.<br />

The impact of modern films and tv series such as the series Mr. Robot and Silicon Valley are strong influences which have swayed me to look more into the industry. 

I am currently a full time employee working as an IT technical support officer for a large conglomerate company. I have been working there for close to 3 years and believe I should further enhance my knowledge of the I.T. industries and technologies in order to up skill myself.<br />

I have decided to study a degree with RMIT as it gives me the flexibility to study online whilst also allowing to continue my employment. I hope to build a more extensive knowledge of new technologies and also find which path of I.T. I would like to follow whether it be cloud computing, networking or big data. If possible I would like to branch my knowledge into AWS.</p>
									
									<h3>Wade toma - S3776749</h3>
									<p> my name is Waleed toma I am 23 years old and I have been interested in learning about technology and computers ever since I got my first computer when I was 12 years old. 
I have chosen RMIT to study Information technology because it was highly recommended to me by my cousins who have studied there and graduated there Bachelor of Accounting. I'm interested in I.T because of how its evolving and how many of us use and rely on it through our lives. </p>
